                <h2>Post Surgical Care</h2>
                <p>Post-surgical care is a critical aspect of recovery that involves comprehensive management to prevent complications and ensure optimal healing. It includes wound care, pain management, infection prevention, and rehabilitation through physiotherapy if necessary. Monitoring vital signs, managing medications, and providing nutritional support are essential to promote tissue repair and immune function. Depending on the type of surgery, specialized care may involve drain management, mobility assistance, or respiratory therapy to prevent issues like pneumonia or blood clots. Patient education on self-care, recognizing warning signs of complications, and regular follow-ups with the healthcare provider play a key role in successful recovery.</p>
